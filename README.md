# GIT VISUALSIER TOOL
The first inital commit of my Git Visualiser tool.
The folder contains my django project.  
(This commit has no API functionality yet. It is simply the django functioning project for now.)

## myenv
To create a virtual enviroment for this all you need to do is   
-pip install virtualenv  
then cd to the folder  
-virtualenv myenv  
and simply   
-\env\Scripts\activate  
Then now the venv is set up and active just install django into the venv  
-pip install django  
-pip install requests  
-pip install pygithub  
  
I intend on creating a terminal script that will do all this for you and also creating a docker instance to be the host.  

## Git Visualiser
Is the folder containg my django project. I used django for 2 reasons, 1) I had aready expermiented with using the API tools in python so i wanted to use that and 2) I wanted to experiment with more packages in Python and django was one that I really wnated to try as Pythyon is my favouruite language and iI wanted to learn how to tie front end and back end into Python.  
To run this simply enter   
-python manage.py runserver
